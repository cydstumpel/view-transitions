          <p class="medium-body">For too long, product teams have accepted the handoff between design and development as a necessary step. But every handoff introduces translation, and with it comes compromise, delay, and diluted intent. What if designers could fully own the path from idea to implementation? This talk explores what a future without design-to-development handoffs could look like. By empowering designers to directly implement their own work, teams can aspire to faster iteration cycles, stronger creative ownership, and products that more faithfully reflect their original vision. This is not just a workflow improvement, it's a call to rethink how great digital products get made.</p>
