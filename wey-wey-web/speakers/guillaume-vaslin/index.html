          Guillaume is a French designer based in Berlin. Early in his career, he founded Eelusion, a game studio behind some of Europe's first augmented reality games. He later served as Managing Director at The European Magazine, where he led the creative direction until its acquisition by Weimar Media Group. He also participated in STARTUP Chile, launching two social ventures while working with prêt-à-porter brands across Latin America. Today, as the founder of ENNOstudio, Guillaume sees design as the bridge between technology and human needs. He focuses on making digital products more inclusive and accessible, collaborating with startups, enterprises, and universities across Europe.
