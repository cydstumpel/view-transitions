          <p class="medium-body">What can we learn from User Interfaces in Sci-Fi? What happens when we try to build some of them? This talk will look at examples of User Interfaces from science fiction and what we learn when we actually try to build them. We'll also take a deep dive into a novel method for visualising data using faces and how learning from it can help us design useful, insightful interfaces of our own.</p>
