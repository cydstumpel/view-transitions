          By day, Candi's a UX content director who loves helping her team thrive, solving complex user experience challenges, and championing inclusive design. With over a decade in experience design - spanning products from banking to dating - she knows a thing or two about IA, AI, and everything in between. By night, she's a published author of four books, a tarot reader, and trained sommelier (who tends not to combine them all at once). A self-confessed "word nerd" with a first-class degree in Linguistics, she's super passionate about the power of language and the impact it has on what people think, feel, and do (on and offline).

          <p class="medium-body">Good, helpful, useful, readable content is at the heart of good design. So, why is it so often seen as an afterthought? This talk hones in on how we can change that, delving into linguistics and examples to highlight why real content is crucial and how UX design and content people can work together to create the most meaningful designs—even when your content designers are stretched thin (or are non-existent at your org!).</p>
