          <p class="medium-body">While AI tools revolutionize rapid prototyping in product development, they haven't yet solved the fundamental infrastructure challenges of production systems. This talk examines two critical areas where traditional engineering investment remains essential: sophisticated user behavior analytics and complex feature management systems. We'll explore why measuring user behavior beyond basic metrics requires custom infrastructure to answer nuanced business questions, and how feature flipper systems must handle intricate combinations of internal and external factors. Through practical examples, we'll demonstrate how to build these essential infrastructures cost-effectively at both early-stage and scale, enabling teams to maintain agility while growing their analytical capabilities. Product teams will learn why these infrastructure investments remain necessary despite AI advances, and how to balance AI-driven innovation with lean, scalable system architecture.</p>
