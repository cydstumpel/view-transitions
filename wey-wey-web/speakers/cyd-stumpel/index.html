          Cyd is a freelance creative developer and part time teacher at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. She creates accessible, award winning websites for everyone; from large organisations like WeTransfer and Amnesty International to creative agencies and freelancers. She's got an eye for details and loves to turn flat designs into rich experiences. Cyd has mostly focused on JavaScript animation over the last couple of years but has rediscovered her passion for CSS this year, rebuilding her portfolio with View Transitions and Scroll Driven Animation.

With the View Transitions API and Scroll-Driven Animations we'll explore how modern CSS is reshaping creative development today and where you can replace JS with CSS solutions.</p>

          <p class="medium-body">Animation can delight your users, give attention to important information and help users to better understand tasks. Finding the balance between too little and too much animation and making your animations suitable to your project is a difficult task. Creating a motion language can help with this. In this workshop I'll teach you techniques to create, and implement a cohesive motion language for your projects with code. We'll look at shapes, direction, durations and ease. Focussing on loading-, interaction-, scroll- and page animations.</p>
