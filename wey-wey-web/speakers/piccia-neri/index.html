          <p class="medium-body">Fix the number one accessibility issue on the web, and make your UI look better doing it. Low contrast and sloppy color choices quietly tank readability, conversions, and trust. This workshop cuts the jargon and shows you how to design and ship accessible color and contrast with confidence. You'll learn to build beautiful, compliant palettes that scale across components and states; use typography and layout to boost contrast beyond color alone; and turn standards into practical checks your team can actually follow—plus the tools and workflow to test, iterate, and ship fast.</p>
