          <p class="medium-body">Our design system, DRUIDS, serves as the foundational layer for Datadog's 20+ products. While highly adopted, this popularity leads to the misconception that every shared UI component belongs to DRUIDS. The reality is a multi-layered approach: product teams build higher-level "kits" that enrich DRUIDS components in product-specific ways. This talk will explore how this technical setup operates in both design tools and codebase, its benefits, and the challenges of guiding designers and engineers in this nuanced ecosystem. We will demonstrate how a multi-layered design system enables organic platform scaling while maintaining a consistent user experience.</p>
