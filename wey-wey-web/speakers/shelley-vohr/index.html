          <p class="medium-body">When we think about JavaScript and Node.js, it's not often most of us are required to consider memory management and allocation. In this talk, we'll jump right into the landfill and get a little dirty as we try to understand how Node.js manages memory with Google's V8 runtime engine. What types of garbage collection are there, and how and when are they used? We'll also explore some of the issues that mismanaged memory can cause, and how they were eventually solved using examples from Node.js and its consumers and embedders like Electron. Memory management is closer to the surface than you might think, so we'll also discuss how to see and create memory issues right from JavaScript. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of the mechanics underlying the web's most ubiquitous language, as well as tips to avoid pitfalls you might not even realize exist!</p>
